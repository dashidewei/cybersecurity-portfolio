## About Me
Title: ma yiding | Cybersecurity Student & Enthusiast

"Hello! I am a dedicated Cybersecurity student with a strong passion for understanding the evolving landscape of digital threats and defenses. My journey in cybersecurity is driven by a curiosity for ethical hacking and a commitment to securing digital environments.

Currently, I am actively honing my practical skills through hands-on platforms like TryHackMe, where I have been diving into Offensive Security and exploring the mindset of an ethical hacker. I enjoy the challenge of identifying vulnerabilities and learning the methodologies used to mitigate them.

With a solid foundation in cybersecurity principles and a continuous learning mindset, I am focused on building a career where I can contribute to creating a safer cyberspace. I am always eager to learn new tools, tackle complex problems, and stay ahead of the latest security trends."

## 5. Learning Journey
[cite_start]Reflecting on my progress in the **WQE7001 Cyber Security** course [cite: 1] and independent study:

* **Advanced Technical Exploration**: 
    I have moved beyond basic concepts to mastering professional-grade tools. I am now proficient in using **Kali Linux** as a primary environment for security testing. My skill set includes automated vulnerability scanning with **Nuclei**, web traffic manipulation and analysis via **Burp Suite**, and leveraging **Google Dorking** and **OSINT** techniques to discover publicly exposed sensitive information. [cite_start]I have also focused deeply on identifying and mitigating **Access Control Vulnerabilities**, understanding how broken authorization can lead to unauthorized data exposure. [cite: 26, 27]

* **Network Simulation and Infrastructure**: 
    A significant part of my learning has involved **GNS3**. Using GNS3, I have successfully simulated complex network topologies to understand real-world traffic flow and security bottlenecks. This hands-on experience has been crucial in bridging the gap between theoretical networking and practical security implementation, allowing me to test firewall rules and intrusion detection systems in a safe, virtualized environment. [cite: 26, 27]

* **Future Growth**: 
    While I have gained confidence in offensive tools, I find the automation of complex security workflows still challenging. I plan to improve by studying Python scripting for security and deepening my knowledge of cloud security architectures. [cite: 27]
